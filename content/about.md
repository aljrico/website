Most people would say I am a **Data Scientist**. Currently I work as **R/Shiny consultant**. Which essentially means that I help develop any kind of tools that sit well in a web app form. But I also spend quite a bit of time improving the statistical insight of academic publications, helping out on - and co-authoring - interesting papers in varied fields.

Of course you can check up all my public work [here](/projects).

## Where do I come from?

I grew up in a tiny village by the sea in the north east of Spain. Empty and silent as a wasteland during winters but warm and bubbling with people from many places during summer. I worked as waiter during all summers (as it's usual there) until I got enough money to pay for my education and move to Barcelona. Where I got my Bachelor's in Physics.

After graduating and doing an internship in climate and oceanographic research, I started a Master's Degree in Financial Mathematics. And why should a physicist care about finance anyway? Well, I had fun crunching numbers to understand the behaviour of complicated things like climate, fluids or particles; and I realised you could do something similar with the financial markets. So long story short, I ended up doing risk analysis in a bank and then researching in actuarial mathematics.

As you might have guessed, I was having more fun with the numbers than with the actual subject matter *and* I was falling in love with coding stuff and automating all the complicated processes that are involved in research or in financial analysis. Eventually I ended up falling into this love triangle between Maths, Programming and Business. So of course I became a **Data Scientist**.

As it often happens with any intersection, nobody is ever really in the middle. Which means that I have been jumping from more purely mathematic projects such supervising the statistical methods of scientific publications, to straight up being the Product Manager of a mobile videogame or to go deep in the woods and spearhead the development of webapps.
