In this section you can check out a selected list of the projects that have been eating away my free time. 

You may wonder why I'm not just showing **all** projects, and the answer to that will always be either browsability (not very friendly to look in a browser) or exclusivity (I've hit the jackpot and a client has paid me to implement it only for them).

## R Packages

## Academic Contributions

Another type gig I enjoy partaking in during my free time has to do with research. As a Statistics Consultant, I have been lucky enough to participate in the elaboration and supervision of certain academic papers. Some of them even as a co-author.

Here's a selected list of some of the papers I have participated in, or I feel particularly proud of:

* [Pre‐contrast CT attenuation of the thyroid gland is lower in brachycephalic dogs versus non‐brachycephalic dogs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/vru.12922)
* [Prevalence and Characterization of Urinary Tract Infection in Owned Dogs and Cats From Spain](https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1cU726utnvw9Tq)
