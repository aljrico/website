      <title>Efficient Column Looping with R</title>

      <description>I’d bet most R developers have - or will have - faced the issue of having to optimise a big piece of code. Some processes might take way too much time, or they are filling memory space until the session explodes and everything crashes.
One of the most infamous caveats of programming with R is how slow it can be to loop through columns of a data.frame. It has been widely discussed and everyone knows that you shouldn’t use a for loop to iterate a function over many columns, you should use the apply() family for that.</description>

      <title>My First R Package: harrypotter</title>

      <description>I want to present you my first R package, already published in CRAN.
I have to say that has been a challenging but very exciting experience. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot of stuff and now I can appreciate that the way packages are structured, and the existence of the CRAN is one of the highlights of R, and one of its strongest advantages over other languages.
This package provides the first round of palettes derived from the Harry Potter film series.</description>

      <title>Genetic Algorithms: Solving the N-Queens problem</title>

      <description>Purpose Throughout this article, I aim to provide with a very simple replicable and practical manual on how to use Genetic Algorithms on optimisation problems. During this, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to outline the philosophy of applying Genetic Algorithms (GA) and the implications of the many decisions involved in building such algorithms. With this goal in mind, we are going to solve the generalised 8-queens problem using three slightly different customized GA algorithms and comparing its advantages and weaknesses; this way getting a glimpse of the crucial points of building a proper GA model.</description>

      <description>In this section you can check out a selected list of the projects that have been eating away my free time.
You may wonder why I&amp;rsquo;m not just showing all projects, and the answer to that will always be either browsability (not very friendly to look in a browser) or exclusivity (I&amp;rsquo;ve hit the jackpot and a client has paid me to implement it only for them).

      <title>Testing Financial Strategies with R: Stock Picking</title>

      <description>One of the most common financial advices that you can hear in every christmas meal is that you should be saving a fixed amount of money each month. Not only that, but you should avoid pre-cooked schemes offered by your bank and simply invest your savings in the stock market. Investing in the U.S. market or even the global stock market has been a wise decision if you look at the long term (more than 10 years), even if you invested in peak of any pre-crisis crest.</description>
