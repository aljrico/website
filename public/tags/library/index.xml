      <description>I want to present you my first R package, already published in CRAN.
I have to say that has been a challenging but very exciting experience. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot of stuff and now I can appreciate that the way packages are structured, and the existence of the CRAN is one of the highlights of R, and one of its strongest advantages over other languages.
This package provides the first round of palettes derived from the Harry Potter film series.</description>
